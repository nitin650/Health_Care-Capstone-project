# Health_Care-Capstone-project
The goal of this exercise was to create a model utilising data that would provide the best insurance cost for an individual. We created several models and chose the best fit model, which delivered 94% accuracy.

Business Problem:

We all know that Health care is very important domain in the market. It is directly linked with the life of the individual; hence we have to be always be proactive in this particular domain. 
Money plays a major role in this domain, because sometime treatment becomes super costly and if any individual is not covered under the insurance then it will become a pretty tough financial situation for that 
individual. The companies in the medical insurance also want to reduce their risk by optimizing the insurance cost, because we all know a healthy body is in the hand of the individual only. If individual 
eat healthy and do proper exercise the chance of getting ill is drastically reduced.
